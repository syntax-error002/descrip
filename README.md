## 💫 About Me  
I build ideas fast — with code, no-code, or whatever bridges the gap between idea and launch.  
From **Flutter apps** and **React dashboards** to **Supabase backends** and **AI integrations**, I focus on making things that are genuinely useful.  

- ⚙️ Skilled in **Flutter, Dart, React, JavaScript, SQL, Supabase, Firebase**  
- 💡 Experienced with **auth systems**, **real-time databases**, and **AI-driven features**  
- ⚡ Explore **Bubble.io** and **low/no-code tools** for quick MVPs  
- 🌱 Currently learning **Next.js** and **clean architecture in Flutter**  
- 🎯 Goal: Build scalable, human-centered tech that stands out
